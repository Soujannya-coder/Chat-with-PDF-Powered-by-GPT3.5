# GPT-Powered Question Answering System from PDF Data

This project aims to create a Question Answering (QA) system powered by GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models using data extracted from PDF documents.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GPT-Powered-Question-Answering-System-from-PDF-Data.git
   cd GPT-Powered-Question-Answering-System-from-PDF-Data.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv chcatbot
   ```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\chcatbot\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source chcatbot/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Create Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables and fill in your API keys and Pinecone configuration:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
     PINECONE_API_KEY = "your_pinecone_api_key"
     PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT = "your_pinecone_environment"
     PINECONE_INDEX_NAME = "your_pinecone_index_name"
     ```

6. **Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run demo.py
   ```

## Usage

- Upon running the project, you will be presented with a Streamlit web application.
- Upload your PDF documents containing information.
- Interact with the system by asking questions related to the uploaded documents.
